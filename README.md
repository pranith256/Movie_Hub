# Description of the Project : 

This is a Web Application developed using React for the front end, NodeJS for the back end, and GraphQL to integrate the backend with MongoDB.
This is an application to store data about trending movies, also we can add the movies of our wish to the list. This application can be used as a favorite movie and make a list of movies to watch
later.

# Technologies used : 
JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, mongoose, MongoDB

1. I have developed the front end using React class components for rendering and used state management
 for passing the props through the modules.
2. I have built a backend using Node.js, express for routing, GraphQL for API creation,
   and querying using GQL to retrieve the data from the backend
3. I have used Mongoose to connect with the MongoDB database and create collections in the
   database.
4. I have integrated GraphQL Schema creation for querying and API creation.
